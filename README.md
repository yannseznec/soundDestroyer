# soundDestroyer
a system for destroying sound

this patch lets you play back the sound. As you listen to the sound it will be destroyed until there is nothing left.

Or, it's just a sound glitcher. The level and permanence of destruction is up to you.

there are some poorly written instructions in the help in the patch. 

it is essentially an improved version of one of the instruments in my Book of Knowledge of Impractical Musical Devices project: http://www.impracticaldevices.com
