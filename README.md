# soundDestroyer
a system for destroying sound

this patch lets you play back a sound. As you listen to the sound it will be destroyed until there is nothing left.

Here's a walkthrough/tutorial video of the patch: https://youtu.be/X8W91SG6Ok4

Or, it's just a sound glitcher. The level and permanence of destruction is up to you.

This patch uses Pure Data "vanilla" with no extra externals or libraries. Download that here: https://puredata.info/downloads

For use on your own computer, open the patch called "_diy_destroy.pd"

There is also a patch especially for running on Bela boards. This mainly just has some presets and interface assignments and is called "_main.pd".

There are some poorly written instructions in the help window in the patch. 

You should be able to map MIDI controllers (or other types of control) easily, though this probably will require some basic understanding of Pure Data.

it is essentially an improved version of one of the instruments in my Book of Knowledge of Impractical Musical Devices project: http://www.impracticaldevices.com
