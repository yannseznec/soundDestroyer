# soundDestroyer
a system for destroying sound

this patch lets you record a sound (or load a sound file), and then play back the sound. As you listen to the playback the sound will be destroyed until there is nothing left.

it is essentially an improved version of one of the instruments in my Book of Knowledge of Impractical Musical Devices project: http://www.impracticaldevices.com

let me know if you have any questions/comments: yann@yannseznec.com, @yannseznec on twitter

to-do: some kind of explanation here or in the patch
